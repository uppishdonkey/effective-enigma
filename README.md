# Module 18 Challenge

## Description
The user is given a social network API. When the user enters the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database. When the users test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then the user is able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
